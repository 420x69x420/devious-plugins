Plugins I make for Devious Client

Right now its just Fight Cave plugin. [99.9% Credit goes to xKylee for the plugin]<https://github.com/xKylee/plugins-source/blob/master/fightcave> , I just found the trigger in the code to flick prayer and added code to enable prayers with Devious API - also it drinks pots (sara brew, super restore, ranged pots at hardcoded lvls, probably should change those)

PS sry Burak wouldn't let me dev for Storm Client so :c
