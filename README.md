Plugins I make for Devious Client

Right now its just Fight Cave plugin. 99.9% Credit goes to xKylee for the plugin <https://github.com/xKylee/plugins-source/blob/master/fightcave> , I just found the trigger in the code to flick prayer and added code to enable prayers with Devious API - also it drinks pots (sara brew, super restore, ranged pots at hardcoded lvls, probably should change those)

Utils folder is just src code for methods and stuff that make developing scripts easier (like Loadouts)

PS sry Burak wouldn't let me dev for Storm Client so :c
